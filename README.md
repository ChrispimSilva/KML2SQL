#KML2SQL

##VERSION 0.2

###Overview
KML2SQL is a program that takes KML files and uploades them to MSSQL geography or geometry files. Currently it's in version 0.2, and does not include any other custom attributes. But that's coming!

Also on the to-do list is provide support for other database types. MSSQL is the first because it has great geospatial support, but getting it working with mySQL, PostgreSQL and mongoDB are high on the "to-do" list.
